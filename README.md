# flexi
Specifications for a primarily functional lexically scoped language that supports dynamic typing

# Primary goals:
Strongly typed language  
Pure functional language  
Dependent types  
Security tokens 
Full calculus of construction support (potentially a weaker form like Agda)  
Data representation as interfaces (easy serialization)  

# Secondary goals:
Easy transition from imperative programming backgrounds  
Optional impure sections of code  
Optional weak typing  
Optional parethesises  

# Influences
Cap'n Proto - Integer overflow guards  
Agda  
Haskell  
Strongly-typed Racket  
Java
